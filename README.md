### <div align="center"> 3D Artist | Game Dev | Specialize in Game and Level Design | Environment Artist


Hi, 
I'm Aniket Patel a Game Designer, Environment Artist, Level Designer, and 3D Artist who loves building immersive game worlds that players can truly get lost in.

For me, it’s not just about making things look good — it's about creating environments that feel alive and meaningful, where gameplay and storytelling come together naturally. Whether it’s 3D modeling, texturing, or designing a level layout, I enjoy every part of the creative process.

I work with tools like Unreal Engine, Unity, Blender, Substance Painter, and Photoshop — and I’m always curious to learn more, try new techniques, and collaborate with people who share the same passion for games and design.

Let’s connect if you're into creating amazing game experiences or just want to exchange ideas!
